This is a minimal kotlin multiplatform project for mixed jvm js projects.
I used the latest and greatest versions of contained tools.

As a starting point, it contains a multiplatform api client that uses
ktor as a http client. Javascript tests are activated and run with mocha.

Not much code, but it was recently quite confusing for me to find up to date examples for
multiplatform projects, how to run javascript tests and so on.
